  <h2 class='c010'>PREFACE.</h2>
<p class='c011'>In justice to the author of “Queen Móo’s Talisman”, it
may be recorded that at the time of its writing, there
was no intention of allowing the verses to go into print; they
were penned only for the one to whom they are dedicated.</p>

<p class='c012'>The songs introduced have been arranged to the metre of the
two or three ancient melodies yet occasionally heard among the
natives of Yucatan. The one to the rain gods is a versification
(set to the tune even now used in a sun-dance) of an old Maya
prayer translated from that language by Dr. Le Plongeon and
published in his work “Queen Móo and the Egyptian Sphinx.”
The melody to which the Love Song is set is not Maya. In
connection with the lines touching upon love and pain it may
be remarked that in the Maya language there is but one word to
express both.</p>

<p class='c012'>In this poem are represented as nearly as possible, the religious
ideas of the Mayas, their belief in <em class='gesperrt'>KU</em>, the Supreme
Intelligence; in the immortality of the soul, and in successive
<span class='pageno' title='x' id='Page_x'></span>lives on earth before returning to the great Source whence all
emanate; also their rites and ceremonies as gathered from
traditions of the natives of Yucatan, the fresco paintings found
at Chicħen, and the books of ancient Maya authors.</p>

<p class='c012'>As the general reader can hardly be expected to be familiar
with the peculiar customs and ideas of the natives of Central
America, these are sufficiently set forth in the Introduction, a
careful perusal of which will greatly contribute to an appreciation
of the poem.</p>

<p class='c012'>Attention is also invited to the separate page containing a list
of the Maya names and their meanings.</p>

<p class='c012'>The second part of this narrative poem must be regarded not
as a matter of belief on the part of the author, but solely as
having been suggested by the belief of the natives who worked
for Dr. Le Plongeon in his explorations among the ruins of
Chicħen.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
<p class='c011'>The word Maya, though not familiar to modern ears, is a
most interesting one to the antiquary. It appears to have
originated with the great nation whose people, as well as their
language and country, bore that name, even thousands of years
back; their empire extended over the land comprised between
the isthmus of Tehuantepec and that of Darien; known collectively
to-day as Central America.</p>

<p class='c012'>Dr. Le Plongeon has shown that in Yucatan and in Egypt the
radical <em class='gesperrt'>MA</em>, of the word Maya, meant <i>earth</i> and <i>place</i>. This
word was used by Hindoo sages to indicate <i>matter</i>, the <i>earth</i>, as
it is found in their cosmogonic diagram. All matter being regarded
as illusion, the word <i>maya</i>, in India, has that meaning.
The mother of Buddha was Maya Devi (Beautiful Illusion).
Maya is <i>matter</i>, the feminine energy of Brahma. But in the
Indian epic, “Ramayana”, Maya is spoken of as a great magician,
an architect, a terrible warrior and famous navigator,
who took forcible possession of, and settled in, the countries at
<span class='pageno' title='xii' id='Page_xii'></span>the south of the Hindostan peninsula. Plainly, the poet personified
as one hero the Maya colonists who long ago made their
way westward, across the Pacific, and settled there.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the shores of the Mediterranean we find nations whose
ancestors seem to have been intimate with the Mayas, for the
names of their country, of their cities, and of their divinities can
be traced to the Maya tongue. Furthermore, their traditions,
customs, architecture, mode of dress, weapons, and even their
alphabetical letters are like those of the Mayas. From records
in stone and MSS. we learn something of the philosophy of the
Maya sages; and the same ideas are found among nations living
in Asia and Africa.</p>

<p class='c012'>Nothing could be more significant than the universality of the
word Maya. In one country it is the name of a god or goddess;
in another that of a hero or heroine; elsewhere that of a cast,
tribe or country. This word is never used to indicate anything
unimportant. In Greece the goddess Maia was daughter of
Atlas, mother of Hermes, the good mother Kubéle, the Earth,
Mother of the gods. We see a vestige of her worship in the still
popular festival of the Maya or May Queen, fair goddess of spring,
May, that very month when the Earth, matter, Maya, lives
again, refreshed by the nourishing rain which, then particularly,
after a season of drought, pours down upon those latitudes where
the Maya nation had its birth.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Maypole dance is yet performed among the natives of
Yucatan, the land where it probably originated. The dancers
are invariably thirteen in number, which may be another reminiscence
of the land submerged beneath the waves of the
Atlantic on the thirteenth day of the Maya month of Zac.</p>

<p class='c012'>This Maypole dance, called in Yucatan “Ribbon Dance” is
<span class='pageno' title='xiii' id='Page_xiii'></span>unquestionably a vestige of sun worship; the ancients, versed in
astronomy, thus celebrated the sun’s entrance into Taurus, and
the vernal equinox. The Maypole, as known in Europe, has
been satisfactorily shown to be the remains of an ancient institution
of Persia, India, and Egypt, where Maya civilization was
carried in past ages. The May Queen is a personification of the
goddess Maya, the feminine forces of nature; possibly too of that
Maya country whence it came. In Yucatan there is no queen
connected with the dance; there it is and was sun worship pure
and simple.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Yucatan, as in the British Isles and elsewhere, the pole is
planted before the residences of leading citizens, and the dance
is performed for a recompense. In Ireland the dancers wore
over their other dress white shirts, a detail which becomes interesting
in view of the fact that the Maya people always dress exclusively
in white.</p>

<p class='c012'>In Dr. Le Plongeon’s prolonged studies among the remarkable
Ruins on the Yucatan peninsula, after finding, by much patient
endeavor, a clue to the hieroglyphic signs covering the walls of
ancient palaces and temples, he clearly saw that the word CAN
was inscribed in a variety of ways on all the buildings, and as
he advanced in his studies, he learned that this had been the
title of several monarchs who constituted a powerful dynasty.
It is a remarkably interesting fact that the same title, spelled
Khan, is to-day given to rulers in many of the Asiatic nations;
furthermore, the principal emblem on the banners of those Khans
is the serpent or dragon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Continued research, including excavations and a close study
of every object found, together with several tableaux of mural
paintings, convinced Dr. Le Plongeon that he had succeeded in
<span class='pageno' title='xiv' id='Page_xiv'></span>tracing certain incidents which occurred in the last family of the
CAN dynasty, and which led to its downfall. Upon studying
the famous Troano MS., he found the same story recorded there;
and the tragic events resulting from the acts of one member of
that family, Prince Aac, are the theme of the present poem.</p>

<p class='c012'>The scene is laid at Chicħen, which appears to have been the
favorite city of the CANS, judging from certain indications,
among these the prevalence of the serpent as an ornament in all
the buildings. These serpents are represented covered with
feathers indicating that they were emblems of Maya potentates.
On ceremonial occasions royal personages and high officials wore
mantles of feathers, whose colors varied according to the rank of
the individual; yellow being that of the royal family, red that
of the nobility, and green that of the learned men. The word
CAN has in the Maya language a great variety of meanings,
as Dr. Le Plongeon explains in his works; it is the generic
name for serpent.</p>

<p class='c012'>The personages whom Dr. Le Plongeon succeeded in tracing
were—the CAN, his Queen, Zoɔ; their three sons—Cay, Aac,
and Coh; and two daughters—Móo and Nicté. There was also
an aged man named Cay, the High Priest, elder brother of the
King. This venerable person is introduced in the early part of
the poem. When he died, his nephew and namesake, Cay, succeeded
to his position and title. Let it be noted that the High
Priest was, as among the Egyptians and the Hindoos of old,
superior in authority to the King himself.</p>

<p class='c012'>At the death of King Can, his daughter Móo became Queen
of Chicħen. As among the Egyptians, and the Incas in Peru,
so among the Mayas, royal brothers and sisters were obliged to
marry each other; in Siam and some other places the same
<span class='pageno' title='xv' id='Page_xv'></span>custom exists to-day. One of Móo’s brothers had therefore to
be Prince consort. Aac aspired to her hand, but Coh, a valiant
leader in battle, and favorite with the people, was her own
choice. This gave rise to lamentable events which caused the
ruin of the dynasty, Aac refusing to be reconciled.</p>

<p class='c012'>In a carving on stone, as well as in the Troano MS. and the
Codex Cortesianus, Dr. Le Plongeon has found records of the
destruction by earthquake, followed by submergence, of a great
island in the Atlantic ocean. The author of the Troano MS.
affirms that this land disappeared under the waves 8,060 years
before the inditing of that volume. It is not known when the
book in question was written, but judging from Egyptian
records, the cataclysm must have occurred between ten and
eleven thousand years ago. In the Maya books the lost land is
called MU.</p>

<p class='c012'>Lately Dr. Le Plongeon has discovered, in translating the inscriptions,
written in Maya language with Egyptian and Maya
characters, which adorn the faces of the Pyramid of Xochicalco,
situated sixty miles to the southwest of the city of Mexico, in
the State of Morelos, eighteen miles from the city of Cuernavaca,
that said pyramid was a commemorative monument raised to
perpetuate the memory of the destruction of the land of Mu
among coming generations, and that it was made an exact model
of the sacred hill in Atlantis which Plato in his Timœus describes
as having been crowned by a temple dedicated to Cleito
and Poseidon.</p>

<p class='c012'>Looking at scenes depicted in mural paintings, one is driven
to the conclusion that the Mayas were much addicted to the
study of occult forces; they certainly used magic mirrors and
appealed to haruspicy in their desire to foretell events. As may
<span class='pageno' title='xvi' id='Page_xvi'></span>be seen in Dr. Le Plongeon’s “Queen Móo”, one tableau
represents a wiseman examining the cracks induced by heat on
the shell of an armadillo and the marks made by the vapor;
from these signs he endeavors to read the fate of the young
Princess Móo. The soothsayer, of the imperial family of China
uses a turtle in the same way in a ceremony called <i>Puu</i>, for the
royal family only, and in state affairs of exceptional importance.</p>

<p class='c012'>Another tableau, also reproduced in “Queen Móo”, represents
one man in his feather mantle, mesmerizing another, showing
that hypnotism was anciently made use of in Yucatan by priests
and wisemen.</p>

<p class='c012'>There can be no doubt that certain stones were considered
efficacious, as talismans. Jadeite, particularly that of a beautiful
apple-green, mottled with grey, was held in high esteem by the
Mayas, if they did not regard it as sacred. They called it
“Bones of the Earth” because it was the hardest stone known
to them. Of the many varieties of jadeite, for which no less
than a hundred and fifty names have been found, according to
Fischer, the apple-green is the most rare.</p>

<p class='c012'>In the great square of the old city of Chicħen, Dr. Le Plongeon
discovered, in the thick forest, two very ancient tombs with some
of their decorative sculptures yet in place; those on one, enabled
him to see that the tomb had been erected to the memory of Coh
by his widow, Queen Móo. In it he found a statue of the Prince
consort; also a large white stone urn, containing what proved,
by chemical analysis, to have been human flesh, charred and
preserved in red oxide of mercury. In the same urn, among
other relics, was a beautiful ornament of green jadeite, like
those decorating the necks of various personages portrayed in
the sculptures of certain edifices.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='xvii' id='Page_xvii'></span>In connection with the statue it must be observed that the
ancient Mayas held a belief similar to that entertained by the
Egyptians, regarding the condition of the soul after death, and
in the same way made a statue of the deceased, with the idea
that this would give the individual a hold upon life. The
natives who aided in bringing Coh’s statue to light, out of the
mausoleum where it had remained concealed for thousands of
years, invariably spoke of it as the “Enchanted Prince”, and
frequently assured its discoverer that he had succeeded in finding
it because he himself had dwelt there in past ages, and was one
of the great men whose effigies were seen on all sides.</p>

<p class='c012'>When the larger portion of the charred viscera found in the
urn was burned, to reduce it to ashes, the natives standing by
exclaimed—“A majestic shade ascends amid the smoke! It is
the form of the enchanted Prince, that seems to fade into nothingness.”
So impressed were the men by what their imagination
had evoked, that all ran from the spot in a state of agitation.</p>

<p class='c012'>On the day when the statue, weighing three thousand pounds,
was taken out of the monument, a party of hostile Indians
suddenly emerged from the forest. One of their number was
aged, and he remarked to his companions, “This represents one
of our great men of antiquity.” Then the young men paid
homage to the statue by bending one knee, in a manner peculiar
to those people.</p>

<p class='c012'>Traditions of their ancestors are not altogether lost among
the natives, as some travelers assert. Many still perform rites
and ceremonies in the depths of forests or in unexplored caverns,
in the darkness of the night, but keep their secrets to themselves,
remembering the tortures inflicted on their fathers by the
Spanish priests to oblige them to forego the religious observances
<span class='pageno' title='xviii' id='Page_xviii'></span>that had been dear to those of their race for countless
generations.</p>

<p class='c012'>In connection with the song to the rain-gods it may be said
that although the natives of Yucatan are to-day Catholic in
name, they really prefer to render homage to some statue of
their forefathers, and cling tenaciously to a few of their old
divinities. Among these may be mentioned Balam (tiger),
guardian of the crops, likewise appealed to as a rain-god. In a
subterranean cavern a few miles from Chicħen, there is an old
image of a man with long beard; this serves as a representation
of Balam, and to it offerings are made. The antiquity of the
carving cannot be doubted, similar ones existing on pillars at
the entrance of a very ancient castle at Chicħen. The figure in
the cavern is on its knees, its hands are raised to a level with
its head, palms upturned. On its back is a bag containing what
the natives say is a cake made of corn and beans. The statue
is now black, owing to the incense and candles with which its
devotees frequently smoke it. Previous to the planting of grain,
they place before it a basin of cool beverage made of corn, also
lighted wax candles and sweet-smelling copal, imploring the
god to grant an abundant harvest. When the crops ripen, the
finest ears are carried to the grimy divinity by men, women, and
children, who within the cavern dance and pray all day long,
some of their quaint instruments serving as accompaniment to
the Latin litanies which they chant, without having even the
vaguest idea of their meaning.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sun-dance mentioned in the Preface, is occasionally performed
by Indians in Yucatan at the time of the vernal equinox.
Twenty men take part—corresponding to the number of days in
the ancient Maya month—but ten dress as women, whence it
<span class='pageno' title='xix' id='Page_xix'></span>may be inferred that in olden times the dancers were of both
sexes. All their faces are covered with masks of deer-skin, and
each has on his head the inverted half-shell of a calabash, with
turkey feathers standing up through a hole in the centre. They
wear their usual spotless white garments, and sandals. Those
clad as women are ornamented with large bead necklaces, principally
red, in imitation of old Maya coin, and all the dancers have
ear-rings. The hostile Indians<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c013'><sup>[1]</sup></a> still pierce their ears as their
ancestors did; the rank of a chief being indicated by his having
a ring in the left ear only, or in the right, or in both.</p>

<p class='c012'>The Master of the dance wears a stiff circular cap, surrounded
by upright peacock feathers that sway with every movement, towering
above all the dancers, and about his shoulders is a string of
big sea-shells. From his neck hangs a metallic representation of
the sun, in whose centre is an all-seeing eye within a triangle,
from which depends a large tongue, symbol of power and wisdom.</p>

<p class='c012'>One man carries a white flag on which is painted an image of
the sun, and a man and woman on their knees worshiping it.
Three men, apart from the dancers, play a clarionet, a <i>sacatan</i>,
and a big turtle-shell beaten with deer-horns. The Master marks
time with a rattle, and in his other hand has a three-thonged
whip like the flagellum of Osiris in Egypt; throughout the performance
he remains standing close to the flag-staff.</p>

<p class='c012'>Each dancer holds in his left hand a fan of turkey feathers
whose handle is a claw of that bird; and in his right a small
rattle made of a calabash shell, fancifully painted, containing
pebbles and dried seeds. These rattles remind us of the sistrums
used anciently in the temples of Egypt.</p>

<p class='c012'><span class='pageno' title='xx' id='Page_xx'></span>Around the pole on which the flag is furled, the dancers walk
three times, with solemn tread, groping their way as if in darkness.
Suddenly the flag is unfurled, the sun appears, all draw
themselves up to their full height, raise their eyes and hands,
and utter a unanimous shout of joy.</p>

<p class='c012'>Now the dance commences, round and round the pole they go with
various steps and motions, not graceful, but energetic and
full of meaning. The dance is intended to represent, among
other things, the course and movement of our planet around the
sun. The chief and the dancers sing alternately:</p>
<div class='lg-container-b c014'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Take care how you step!”</div>
      <div class='line'>“We step well, O Master!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The melody and strange accompaniment are impressive and
stirring, the rattles being particularly effective, now imitating
the scattering of grain, then by a brisk motion of every arm
sending forth a sound like a sudden rainfall on parched leaves,
or a thunder clap in the distance, uniting with a shout raised by
the dancers at the conclusion of each chorus. The fans, kept in
motion, are emblematic of refreshing breezes.</p>

<p class='c012'>The flag on the pole is undoubtedly a modern addition, simply
to indicate what the dance originally was; of old, the pole itself
represented the central orb; as the round towers did in Ireland,
Persia, and India; the conical stones in Phoenicia; the pyramids
and obelisks in Egypt, etc.—for in America, as in those countries,
sun worship was the religion of the people.</p>

<p class='c012'>Finally, the expression “Will Supreme” in the opening line
of the poem is used in the sense of the Maya word UOL (or <i>will</i>)
as applied by the Mayas of ancient times to the First Great
Cause. This subject has been fully treated elsewhere by Dr. Le
Plongeon.</p>

  <h2 class='c010'>ARGUMENT.</h2>
<h3 class='c016'>I.</h3>
<p class='c011'>A soul returns to earth to live again in mortal form as
daughter of a potentate who rules over the Maya Empire.
When the Princess reaches womanhood, the High Priest
Cay, her father’s brother, describes to her the destruction of the
great land whence her people came; consults Fate regarding
her future; gives advice to the Princess, and presents her with a
talismanic stone, warning her that its loss might deprive her of
her throne.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>II.</h3>
<p class='c011'>The Princess is wooed by two of her brothers, who thus become
rivals. Her preference is for Coh, whom she weds. Cay
prophesies to her that in another earthly incarnation she will
again be the sister and wife of him she has chosen for consort.</p>

<p class='c012'>Aac, the unsuccessful suitor, is filled with jealous wrath.</p>

<p class='c012'>The sovereign Can, and his brother the High Priest Cay, both
pass away. The Can’s eldest son, also named Cay, becomes High
<span class='pageno' title='xxii' id='Page_xxii'></span>Priest; Móo is Queen of Chicħen, and her consort the supreme
military chief.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>III.</h3>
<p class='c011'>The Prince consort is treacherously slain by his brother Aac,
who admits his guilt, and is banished from the royal city, his
elder brother warning him that he, Aac, will cause the downfall
of the Can dynasty.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>IV.</h3>
<p class='c011'>Multitudes assemble to bewail the death of Coh and witness
the funeral rites. His ashes are laid to rest and, with his
charred heart, deposited in a stone urn, the widowed Queen
places her talisman, hoping to thus link her destiny with that of
Coh. She builds a monument over his mortal remains and a
statue made to his likeness, and erects a memorial hall, upon
whose exterior walls she inscribes an invocation to the <i>manes</i> of
her consort.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>V.</h3>
<p class='c011'>Notwithstanding his crime, Aac ventures to renew his entreaties.
Failing in his desire, he brings about a war that causes
the ruin of the country and people. Finally the Queen is captured
and imprisoned by Aac; but she is rescued by loyal subjects
and with them flees to foreign lands.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>VI.</h3>
<p class='c011'>Aac, frustrated even in his hour of triumph, becomes a tyrant,
oppresses those under his sway, turns a deaf ear to better promptings,
and at last is killed in a contest with some of his own subjects,
who would restrain him. The famous CAN dynasty is
thus brought to its close.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' title='xxiii' id='Page_xxiii'></span>
<h3 class='c017'>VII.</h3>
</div>
<p class='c011'>The Queen and her rescuers find tranquillity in the land of the
Nile, where, long before, Maya colonists had made their homes.
Here, Móo is received with open arms, and reigns again to the
hour of her death.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>SEQUEL.</h3>
<h3 class='c016'>I.</h3>
<p class='c011'>After many centuries have passed away, in a land far distant
from that of the Mayas, Death snatches a baby girl from a loving
brother. He stays upon earth; his lost sister again takes mortal
form in another family; they meet and are united; the prophecy
of the High Priest Cay being thus fulfilled. Together they
journey to the land of the Mayas where, in the tomb of Coh, they
find his heart and Móo’s talisman, in the urn in which she had
deposited it many centuries before.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>II.</h3>
<p class='c011'>Among the ruins of his palace Aac’s spirit wanders desolate,
pleading for the blessing of forgetfulness in rebirth.</p>

<h3 class='c016'>III.</h3>
<p class='c011'>The talisman brings visions of the long ago, voices of the
Past; Cay, the Wise, still lives, still leads the way to paths of
peace.</p>

      <div class='line'>The multitude, when Móo the torch applied,</div>

      <div class='line'>’Twas plain the war that he ungrateful sought,</div>

      <div class='line'>With just wrath filled Móo scorned the victor’s plea—</div>
      <div class='line'>Lose all she rather would, her palace flee.</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Too soon indeed was this to come about,</div>

      <div class='line'>The noble Pontiff was at once abased</div>

      <div class='line'>The future might, perchance, hold something yet.</div>
      <div class='line'>And when the sun arose, the sails were set,</div>

      <div class='line'>And thus ’twas writ above his palace door,</div>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Now came the days when Mayas knew no peace</div>

      <div class='line'>While yet he spake his blows fell thick and fast;</div>
      <div class='line'>Then Aac, in flaming wrath, stabbed deep his foe;</div>
      <div class='line'>Their blood in mingling stream was quick to flow.</div>
      <div class='line'>’Twas fierce and brief, the Prince was first to fall,</div>
